								<p class="slide__description">The process that is used for quantum computing in the state that it is now is a fairly new technology with most major developments happening in the early 21st century. The main way quantum computing differs from the standard method used in our home computers is that the bits in a computer can either have a value of 1 or of 0 where as a qubit, which is the type of bit used in quantum computers, can be in any proportion of either. This state of a qubit is called super positioning, however when a the positioning of an qubit in superposition is measured the qubit will be locked in either a position of 1 or 0 were as before it could be either (think sch√∂dingers cat, as long as it is not checked the cat is both dead and alive). The second difference between them is that qubits may be in a state of entanglement, this though it poses a challenge, has its advantages as when two entangled qubits in superposition only one needs to be measured. The reason behind this is that when one of two entangled superposition qubits is measured its partner will automatically assume the opposite state, for example if the first qubit assumes the position of 1 then its partner will automatically assume position 0 and vice versa. The factor of superposition is very vital as to why quantum computing is as effective as it is described to be, on a conventional computer a set of 4 bits can only be in 1 out of 16 states while a collection of 4 qubits can be in all states at once, using this knowledge and clever use of entanglement the process of calculation in a computer can be fractionated, this is because a normal computer has to test one combination after another were as the qubits in a quantum computer are already in the required position thanks to super positioning.</p>

								<p> 1970- In 1970 the concept of the type of coding that is used in qunatum computing was created by a man named Stephen Wisner </p>
								<p>1980- the idea of quantum computing was first proposed by Yuri Manin </p>
								<p>1995- the first quantum logic gate was created by Christopher Monroe and David Wineland </p>
								<p>1996- this was the year in which the Army research lab first comissioned the United States government to begin research into quantum processing </p>
								<p>2000- In the year 2000 both the first 5 and 7 qubit NMR processors were sucsessfully tested</p>
								<p>2015- in June of 2015 there was a major breakthrough in quantum copmputing technology as the commpany known as D-Wave claimed to have broken the 1000 qbit barier</p>
